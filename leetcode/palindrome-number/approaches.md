# Arrays & Hashing

For the Arrays & Hashing approach, you can convert the integer into an array of digits and then check if the array is a palindrome. Here's a Python implementation:

```python
def isPalindrome(x):
    # Convert the integer to an array of digits
    digits = []
    temp_x = abs(x)
    while temp_x > 0:
        digits.append(temp_x % 10)
        temp_x //= 10
    
    # Check if the array is a palindrome
    return digits == digits[::-1]

# Test cases
print(isPalindrome(121))   # Output: True
print(isPalindrome(-121))  # Output: False
print(isPalindrome(10))    # Output: False
```

Explanation:
1. We convert the integer `x` to its absolute value (`temp_x`) to handle negative numbers.
2. We extract the digits of `temp_x` and append them to the `digits` array.
3. Finally, we check if the `digits` array is equal to its reverse (`digits[::-1]`), indicating whether the original integer is a palindrome.

This solution has a time complexity of O(log10(x)), where x is the input integer, as we are essentially extracting its digits. The space complexity is O(log10(x)) as well, considering the space required for the `digits` array.

# Two Pointers

For the Two Pointers approach, we use two pointers, one starting from the beginning and the other from the end of the integer. We compare the digits pointed to by these two pointers. Here's a Python implementation:

```python
def isPalindrome(x):
    # Convert the integer to a string for easy indexing
    str_x = str(abs(x))
    
    # Initialize two pointers
    left, right = 0, len(str_x) - 1
    
    # Check if the digits at the two pointers are equal
    while left < right:
        if str_x[left] != str_x[right]:
            return False
        left += 1
        right -= 1
    
    return True

# Test cases
print(isPalindrome(121))   # Output: True
print(isPalindrome(-121))  # Output: False
print(isPalindrome(10))    # Output: False
```

Explanation:
1. We convert the integer `x` to its absolute value and then to a string (`str_x`).
2. We initialize two pointers, `left` and `right`, pointing to the beginning and end of the string, respectively.
3. We compare the digits at the two pointers and move towards each other until they meet in the middle.
4. If at any point the digits are not equal, we return False, indicating that the integer is not a palindrome.
5. If the loop completes without returning False, we return True.

This solution has a time complexity of O(log10(x)), where x is the input integer, as we are essentially iterating through the digits. The space complexity is O(log10(x)), considering the space required for the string conversion.

# Stack

For the Stack approach, we can use a stack to reverse the digits of the integer, and then compare the reversed digits with the original integer. Here's a Python implementation:

```python
def isPalindrome(x):
    # Convert the integer to an array of digits
    digits = []
    temp_x = abs(x)
    while temp_x > 0:
        digits.append(temp_x % 10)
        temp_x //= 10
    
    # Use a stack to reverse the digits
    stack = []
    for digit in digits:
        stack.append(digit)
    
    # Check if the reversed digits are equal to the original digits
    while digits:
        if digits.pop() != stack.pop():
            return False
    
    return True

# Test cases
print(isPalindrome(121))   # Output: True
print(isPalindrome(-121))  # Output: False
print(isPalindrome(10))    # Output: False
```

Explanation:
1. We convert the integer `x` to its absolute value (`temp_x`) and extract its digits into the `digits` array.
2. We use a stack to reverse the order of the digits, pushing each digit onto the stack.
3. We compare the digits in the `digits` array with the digits popped from the stack. If at any point they are not equal, we return False.
4. If the loop completes without returning False, we return True.

This solution has a time complexity of O(log10(x)), where x is the input integer, as we are essentially extracting and comparing its digits. The space complexity is O(log10(x)), considering the space required for the `digits` array and the stack.

# Linked List

For the Linked List approach, we can convert the integer into a linked list and check if the linked list is a palindrome. However, since the problem specifies not converting the integer to a string, we'll create a linked list by reversing the second half of the digits and then comparing it with the first half. Here's a Python implementation:

```python
class ListNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
        self.val = val
        self.next = next

def isPalindrome(x):
    # Convert the integer to an array of digits
    digits = []
    temp_x = abs(x)
    while temp_x > 0:
        digits.append(temp_x % 10)
        temp_x //= 10
    
    # Create a linked list from the digits
    head = ListNode(digits[0])
    current = head
    for digit in digits[1:]:
        current.next = ListNode(digit)
        current = current.next
    
    # Reverse the second half of the linked list
    slow = head
    fast = head
    while fast and fast.next:
        slow = slow.next
        fast = fast.next.next
    
    # Compare the first half with the reversed second half
    first_half = head
    second_half = reverse_linked_list(slow)
    while second_half:
        if first_half.val != second_half.val:
            return False
        first_half = first_half.next
        second_half = second_half.next
    
    return True

def reverse_linked_list(head):
    prev = None
    current = head
    while current:
        next_node = current.next
        current.next = prev
        prev = current
        current = next_node
    return prev

# Test cases
print(isPalindrome(121))   # Output: True
print(isPalindrome(-121))  # Output: False
print(isPalindrome(10))    # Output: False
```

Explanation:
1. We convert the integer `x` to its absolute value (`temp_x`) and extract its digits into the `digits` array.
2. We create a linked list from the digits.
3. We find the middle of the linked list using the slow and fast pointer technique.
4. We reverse the second half of the linked list.
5. We compare the first half with the reversed second half to determine if the original integer is a palindrome.

This solution has a time complexity of O(log10(x)), where x is the input integer, as we are essentially extracting and manipulating its digits. The space complexity is O(log10(x)), considering the space required for the linked list.

# Math & Geometry

For the Math & Geometry approach, we can use mathematical operations to reverse the digits of the integer and then compare the reversed digits with the original integer. Here's a Python implementation:

```python
def isPalindrome(x):
    # Handle negative numbers
    if x < 0:
        return False
    
    # Reverse the digits using mathematical operations
    reversed_x = 0
    original_x = x
    while x > 0:
        digit = x % 10
        reversed_x = reversed_x * 10 + digit
        x //= 10
    
    # Check if the reversed digits are equal to the original digits
    return original_x == reversed_x

# Test cases
print(isPalindrome(121))   # Output: True
print(isPalindrome(-121))  # Output: False
print(isPalindrome(10))    # Output: False
```

Explanation:
1. We handle negative numbers by returning False, as palindromes cannot be negative.
2. We reverse the digits using mathematical operations by repeatedly extracting the last digit (`digit`) and building the reversed number (`reversed_x`).
3. We check if the reversed digits are equal to the original digits.

This solution has a time complexity of O(log10(x)), where x is the input integer, as we are essentially extracting and manipulating its digits. The space complexity is O(1), as we use a constant amount of space for variables.
