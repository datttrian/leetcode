# 506. Relative Ranks

You are given an integer array `score` of size `n`, where `score[i]` is
the score of the `i`<sup>`th`</sup> athlete in a competition. All the
scores are guaranteed to be **unique**.

The athletes are **placed** based on their scores, where the
`1`<sup>`st`</sup> place athlete has the highest score, the
`2`<sup>`nd`</sup> place athlete has the `2`<sup>`nd`</sup> highest
score, and so on. The placement of each athlete determines their rank:

-   The `1`<sup>`st`</sup> place athlete's rank is `"Gold Medal"`.
-   The `2`<sup>`nd`</sup> place athlete's rank is `"Silver Medal"`.
-   The `3`<sup>`rd`</sup> place athlete's rank is `"Bronze Medal"`.
-   For the `4`<sup>`th`</sup> place to the `n`<sup>`th`</sup> place
    athlete, their rank is their placement number (i.e., the
    `x`<sup>`th`</sup> place athlete's rank is `"x"`).

Return an array `answer` of size `n` where `answer[i]` is the **rank**
of the `i`<sup>`th`</sup> athlete.

 

**Example 1:**

    Input: score = [5,4,3,2,1]
    Output: ["Gold Medal","Silver Medal","Bronze Medal","4","5"]
    Explanation: The placements are [1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th].

**Example 2:**

    Input: score = [10,3,8,9,4]
    Output: ["Gold Medal","5","Bronze Medal","Silver Medal","4"]
    Explanation: The placements are [1st, 5th, 3rd, 2nd, 4th].

 

**Constraints:**

-   `n == score.length`
-   `1 <= n <= 10`<sup>`4`</sup>
-   `0 <= score[i] <= 10`<sup>`6`</sup>
-   All the values in `score` are **unique**.
