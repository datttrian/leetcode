# Intuition
The problem requires finding two indices in an integer array whose values sum up to a given target number. One intuitive approach is to iterate through the array and, for each element, check if there is another element in the array whose sum with the current element equals the target. To improve efficiency, we can use a dictionary to store the numbers and their corresponding indices as we iterate through the array.

# Approach
1. Initialize an empty dictionary (`num_dict`) to store numbers and their indices.
2. Iterate through the list of numbers (`nums`) using the `enumerate` function to keep track of the current index.
3. For each number in the list, calculate the complement (the difference between the target and the current number).
4. Check if the complement is already in the dictionary. If it is, return a list containing the indices of the two numbers that add up to the target.
5. If the complement is not in the dictionary, store the current number and its index in the dictionary.
6. If no solution is found during the iteration, return an empty list.

# Complexity
- Time complexity: O(n), where n is the number of elements in `nums`. The function iterates through the list only once.
- Space complexity: O(n), for the dictionary used to store the number indices.

# Code
```python
from typing import List, Dict


class Solution:
    def twoSum(self, nums: List[int], target: int) -> List[int]:
        """
        Find two indices in an integer array whose values sum up to a given
        target number.

        The function iterates through the list of numbers, using a dictionary
        to store the numbers and their corresponding indices. For each number,
        it checks whether there is a complement in the table (i.e., a number
        which added to the current number equals the target). If such a
        complement is found, the function returns a list containing the indices
        of the two numbers. If no two numbers add up to the target, the
        function returns an empty list.

        Parameters:
        - nums (List[int]): List of integers to search within.
        - target (int): The target sum to find.

        Returns:
        - List[int]: A list containing the indices of the two numbers that add
        up to the target.

        Raises:
        - This function assumes that there is exactly one solution, and it
        does not handle the case where no solution exists.

        Complexity:
        - Time: O(n), where n is the number of elements in `nums`. The
        function iterates through the list only once.
        - Space: O(n), for the dictionary used to store the number indices.
