Here's how it works, step by step, with the example string `s = "cbbd"`.

1. **Initialization**:
   - The length `n` of the string `"cbbd"` is 4.
   - `is_palindrome` is a 4x4 table initialized with `False`.
   - `start` is initialized to 0, and `max_length` to 1, because every single character is a palindrome.

2. **Base Case for Substrings of Length 1**:
   - Loop through `i` from 0 to 3, and set `is_palindrome[i][i]` to `True`, since all individual characters are palindromes.
   
   After this step, `is_palindrome` looks like this:
   ```
   T F F F
   F T F F
   F F T F
   F F F T
   ```
   ('T' for `True`, and 'F' for `False`)

3. **Check for Palindromes of Length 2**:
   - Loop through `i` from 0 to 2 (since we're checking pairs), and if `s[i] == s[i+1]`, then `is_palindrome[i][i+1]` is set to `True`.
   - For `s = "cbbd"`, `s[1] == s[2]` (`b == b`), so we update `is_palindrome[1][2]` to `True`, `start` to 1, and `max_length` to 2.
   
   After this step, `is_palindrome` looks like this:
   ```
   T F F F
   F T T F
   F F T F
   F F F T
   ```

4. **Check for Palindromes of Length 3 or More**:
   - Now we check for lengths from 3 to 4 (the length of `s`).
   - For length 3, no new palindromes are found.
   - For length 4, we check if `s[0] == s[3]` and if the substring `s[1]` to `s[2]` (`"bb"`) is a palindrome. The first and last characters do not match (`c != d`), so no updates are made for length 4.

5. **Return the Longest Palindromic Substring**:
   - After the loop finishes, we have found that the longest palindrome has `start = 1` and `max_length = 2`.
   - The function returns `s[start : start + max_length]`, which is `s[1 : 1 + 2]` or `"bb"`.

The final output for the input `"cbbd"` is `"bb"`, which is the longest palindromic substring in the given string.
