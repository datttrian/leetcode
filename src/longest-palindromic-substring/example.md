Certainly! Let's go through the algorithm step by step using the string `"babad"` as an example:

1. **Initialize variables**:
   - `res` = "" (empty string)
   - `resLen` = 0

2. **First iteration (i = 0, character 'b')**:
   - **Odd length check**: Set `l = 0`, `r = 0`.
     - Check if `s[l] == s[r]`? Yes ('b' == 'b'), so enter the while loop.
     - Current substring is "b", length is 1, which is greater than `resLen` (0), so update `res = "b"`, `resLen = 1`.
     - Expand `l` to -1 and `r` to 1, but `l` is now out of bounds, exit the while loop.
   - **Even length check**: Set `l = 0`, `r = 1`.
     - Check if `s[l] == s[r]`? No ('b' != 'a'), so don't enter the while loop.

3. **Second iteration (i = 1, character 'a')**:
   - **Odd length check**: Set `l = 1`, `r = 1`.
     - Check if `s[l] == s[r]`? Yes ('a' == 'a'), so enter the while loop.
     - Current substring is "a", length is 1, which is not greater than `resLen` (1), so don't update.
     - Expand `l` to 0 and `r` to 2. Check if `s[l] == s[r]`? Yes ('b' == 'b'), so enter the while loop.
     - Current substring is "bab", length is 3, which is greater than `resLen` (1), so update `res = "bab"`, `resLen = 3`.
     - Expand `l` to -1 and `r` to 3, but `l` is now out of bounds, exit the while loop.
   - **Even length check**: Set `l = 1`, `r = 2`.
     - Check if `s[l] == s[r]`? No ('a' != 'b'), so don't enter the while loop.

4. **Third iteration (i = 2, character 'b')**:
   - Repeat similar steps as before. Neither the odd nor even length checks will find a longer palindrome than "bab".

5. **Fourth iteration (i = 3, character 'a')**:
   - This will be similar to the second iteration. It will check for palindromes with the center at 'a', but won't find one longer than "bab".

6. **Fifth iteration (i = 4, character 'd')**:
   - This will not find any palindrome longer than "bab" either.

7. **Return result**:
   - After completing the loop, the function will return the longest palindrome found, which is "bab".

Throughout this process, the function keeps track of the longest palindrome by updating `res` and `resLen` whenever it finds a longer palindrome than previously recorded. For `"babad"`, the longest palindrome that can be formed is "bab" or "aba", and since the algorithm updates the result when it first finds the longest palindrome, it returns "bab".
