Let's break down how the `convert` method of the `Solution` class works using the string `"PAYPALISHIRING"` with `numRows = 4`. The string will be written in a zigzag pattern and then read line by line.

1. **Check for edge cases**:
   - If `numRows` is 1 or greater than the length of `s`, the zigzag pattern doesn't apply. Here, it's not the case, so we proceed.

2. **Initialization**:
   - Create `rows`, an array of empty strings, with a length equal to `numRows`. (`rows = ["", "", "", ""]` for `numRows = 4`).
   - Set `current_row` to 0, which is the index of the first row.
   - Set the `going_down` flag to False, indicating the initial direction of writing is upwards.

3. **Populate the zigzag pattern**:
   - Loop over each character in the input string `s`, appending each character to the correct row in `rows` based on `current_row`.
   - If `current_row` is 0 or `numRows - 1`, flip the `going_down` flag to reverse the direction.
   - Update `current_row` to move up or down the zigzag pattern. If `going_down` is True, increment `current_row`; if False, decrement `current_row`.

4. **Step by step for "PAYPALISHIRING"**:
   - Start with the first character `P`:
     - `current_row = 0`, so append `P` to `rows[0]`. `rows` now looks like `["P", "", "", ""]`.
     - `current_row` is 0, so set `going_down` to True and increment `current_row` to 1.
   - Next character `A`:
     - Append `A` to `rows[1]`. `rows` is now `["P", "A", "", ""]`.
     - Still going down, increment `current_row` to 2.
   - Next character `Y`:
     - Append `Y` to `rows[2]`. `rows` is now `["P", "A", "Y", ""]`.
     - Increment `current_row` to 3, still going down.
   - Next character `P`:
     - Append `P` to `rows[3]`. `rows` is now `["P", "A", "Y", "P"]`.
     - `current_row` is now `numRows - 1`, so flip `going_down` to False and decrement `current_row` to 2.
   - Continue this pattern until the end of the string.

5. **Final `rows` content after completion**:
   - After completing the loop for all characters in `s`, `rows` will look like this:
     ```
     ["P", "I", "N"]
     ["A", "L", "S", "I", "G"]
     ["Y", "A", "H", "R"]
     ["P", "I"]
     ```
6. **Concatenate all rows**:
   - Concatenate all strings in `rows` to form the final string.

7. **Return the result**:
   - The final string after concatenation will be `"PINALSIGYAHRPI"`, which is what the method will return.

This is how the `convert` method transforms the input string into the zigzag pattern and reads it line by line.
