Your code implements the classic "3Sum" problem solution using a two-pointer approach. Here's a detailed comment for better understanding:

python
Copy code
from typing import List, Tuple

class Solution:
    def threeSum(self, nums: List[int]) -> List[Tuple[int, int, int]]:
        # Sort the input list to facilitate the two-pointer approach
        nums.sort()
        
        # Initialize the result list to store unique triplets
        result: List[Tuple[int, int, int]] = []

        # Iterate through the sorted list, considering each element as the potential first element of the triplet
        for i in range(len(nums) - 2):
            # Avoid duplicates for the first element of the triplet
            if i > 0 and nums[i] == nums[i - 1]:
                continue

            # Initialize left and right pointers for the remaining elements in the list
            left, right = i + 1, len(nums) - 1
            
            # Use a two-pointer approach to find the other two elements that sum to zero
            while left < right:
                total = nums[i] + nums[left] + nums[right]
                
                # Adjust pointers based on the sum
                if total < 0:
                    left += 1
                elif total > 0:
                    right -= 1
                else:
                    # Found a triplet, add it to the result list
                    result.append((nums[i], nums[left], nums[right]))
                    
                    # Skip duplicates for the second and third elements of the triplet
                    while left < right and nums[left] == nums[left + 1]:
                        left += 1
                    while left < right and nums[right] == nums[right - 1]:
                        right -= 1
                    left += 1
                    right -= 1

        # Return the list of unique triplets that sum to zero
        return result
This comment provides a clear explanation of the purpose of each part of the code, making it easier for others (and yourself) to understand the logic and functionality.

Certainly! Below is a carefully written docstring for the threeSum method in your Solution class:

python
Copy code
from typing import List, Tuple

class Solution:
    def threeSum(self, nums: List[int]) -> List[Tuple[int, int, int]]:
        """
        Find all unique triplets in the given list of integers that sum up to zero.

        Args:
            nums (List[int]): A list of integers.

        Returns:
            List[Tuple[int, int, int]]: A list of tuples representing unique triplets,
            where each triplet (a, b, c) satisfies the condition a + b + c = 0.

        Note:
            The input list is sorted in non-decreasing order to facilitate the two-pointer approach.
            The algorithm avoids duplicate triplets and elements within a triplet.

        Example:
            >>> solution = Solution()
            >>> nums = [-1, 0, 1, 2, -1, -4]
            >>> solution.threeSum(nums)
            [(-1, -1, 2), (-1, 0, 1)]

        """

This docstring provides a clear description of the purpose of the method, the input parameters, the return type, and additional notes for understanding the behavior of the function. The example demonstrates how to use the method with a sample input.

write complexity in the docstring
ChatGPT
Certainly! I'll include the time and space complexity analysis in the docstring:

python
Copy code
from typing import List, Tuple

class Solution:
    def threeSum(self, nums: List[int]) -> List[Tuple[int, int, int]]:
        """
        Find all unique triplets in the given list of integers that sum up to zero.

        This method employs a two-pointer approach on a sorted list of integers to efficiently
        locate unique triplets (a, b, c) where a + b + c = 0. The algorithm avoids duplicate
        triplets and ensures uniqueness within each triplet.

        Args:
            nums (List[int]): A list of integers.

        Returns:
            List[Tuple[int, int, int]]: A list of tuples representing unique triplets,
            where each triplet (a, b, c) satisfies the condition a + b + c = 0.

        Note:
            The input list is sorted in non-decreasing order to facilitate the two-pointer approach.
            The algorithm avoids duplicate triplets and elements within a triplet.

        Complexity:
            Time:
                The time complexity is O(n^2), where n is the length of the input list.
                The dominant factor is the two-pointer traversal within the nested loop.

            Space:
                The space complexity is O(1), as the algorithm uses only a constant amount of
                additional space for variables and does not rely on auxiliary data structures.

        Example:
            >>> solution = Solution()
            >>> nums = [-1, 0, 1, 2, -1, -4]
            >>> solution.threeSum(nums)
